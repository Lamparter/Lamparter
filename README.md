### 🐱 What's FluentHub?

<!--[`Github`](https://github.com/FluentHub/FluentHub), [`Download`](https://github.com/FluentHub/FluentHub/releases), [`Microsoft Store`](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NKB9HX8RJZ3)-->

FluentHub is a stylish yet powerful GitHub client for Windows. Powered by GitHub's amazing [`GraphQL API`](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.graphql.net), FluentHub is an wonderful fluent alternative to GitHub's own website.

### 💎 What's Emerald?

Emerald is an open-source Minecraft client redesigned to work with the fluent design system; it's the perfect companion to your Windows 11 gaming setup. With beautiful, crystal-clear graphics, you won't be needing your specialised ray-tracing card anymore because Emerald already does it. Emerald *really* does live up to its classy, sparkly, and elegant name.

### 🔗 What's Protocol?

Protocol is a videogame set in an alternate dimension, an Otherworld. It is a bullet-proof idea and has slowly been conceptualised for over five years. Protocol has many sub-games, such as Area, Cube, Otherworld and more! However, these games don't exactly follow the same *protocol*.. They each have their own interpretation of how the world started.

### ⚡ What's Flux?

Flux - making the world's best 'fkcd' programming language. Flux utilises Python's module feature and the Sun Valley `ttk` theme to deliver good looks with good performance. Because it is Python based, it is more simple but a great competitor to Microsoft's C# as it performs many similar functions. As well as this, Flux aims to bring coding to all ages, as well as making it easier for those already coding. Because of Flux's 'fkcd' architecture it sports the ability to process normal Python code, as well as its own, making the perfect transition. Heaven for any developer.

### 🖥️ What's Desktop Management?

Desktop Management simplifies your workspace by making easier to access the power-user tools you need, but still in a user-friendly way. With descriptions for every task, Desktop Management allows you to easily access the normal Windows tools you love.

### 🎍 What's Plaza?

Plaza is a fluent open-source messaging client built with WinUI for the Universal Windows Platform. It's also designed for Windows Phone and is an easy to use app.
Plaza is based on [`Noobsenger`](https://github.com/NoobNotFound), but rather than being hosted locally, Plaza is hosted on Azure/Andrexial servers.
