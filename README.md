### 🐱 What's FluentHub?

FluentHub is a stylish yet powerful GitHub client for Windows. Powered by GitHub's amazing [`GraphQL API`](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.graphql.net), FluentHub is an wonderful fluent alternative to GitHub's own website.

### 💎 What's Emerald?

Emerald is an open-source Minecraft client redesigned to work with the fluent design system; it's the perfect companion to your Windows 11 gaming setup. With beautiful, crystal-clear graphics, you won't be needing your specialised ray-tracing card anymore because Emerald already does it. Emerald *really* does live up to its classy, sparkly, and elegant name.

### 🔗 What's Protocol?

Protocol is a videogame set in an alternate dimension, an Otherworld. It is a bullet-proof idea and has slowly been conceptualised for over five years. Protocol has many sub-games, such as Area, Cube, Otherworld and more! However, these games don't exactly follow the same *protocol*.. They each have their own interpretation of how the world started. 

### 🏗️ Suspension

[`Protocol`](https://github.com/DepthCDLS/Protocol) is suspended for the purpose of prioritising work on [`FluentHub`](https://github.com/FluentHub/FluentHub) and [`Emerald`](https://github.com/DepthCDLS/Emerald). However, my friends may want to pick up the project in their free-time.
